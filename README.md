# L1ghtingvibes

It's a side project that I made for myself since when I use my own membrane keyboard and it does not have a really good sound, so I tried MechvibesPlusPlus and was amazing, but there was some little things that I decided to upgrade.

- You can add more keyboard sound set by recording any sound you like and add them to this app with some easy steps.

- Use your laptop keyboard or non-mechanical keyboard at work and still hear your loved sound.

- Use this app as any purpose as you want (such as demo for the buyer about the keyboard sound before they buy it, custom any sound for any key...)

- Added better random sounds.

- KeyUp sound as well as mouse sounds.

With L1ghtingVibes Editor, you can create a new sound pack, edit existing sound pack or share them with your friends.

### How to use and install

- Download it from [Releases](https://github.com/L1ghtingBolt/lightingvibes/releases/latest)
- Run it. Install for all users.
- Enjoy it.
- To use mouse, keyup or random sounds, right click it in the system tray.


## Building

As the original Mechvibes or MechvibesPlusPlus don't have build instructions, I'm gonna do them myself.

### Building Dependencies:
1. Install NodeJS,
2. Install yarn: `npm install yarn`
3. Install dependencies. Execute this command in l1ghtingvibes directory: `yarn install`.

### Building the app.
Simply do `npm run build:win/linux/mac`.

### Issues

At installing, install for all users, otherwise it may not work properly.
